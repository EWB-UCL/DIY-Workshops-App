							<div class="cd-faq-content">
								<h7>The project is aimed at inspiring secondary school students to design, prototype and create their own renewable energy devices within an exciting engineering environment. The workshops are designed to encourage innovation in an initial ideation phase, teach basic design skills, introduce students to user-friendly graphics software and subsequently give experience in prototyping and final manufacture of small-scale energy devices, such as chargers, turbines etc.. </h7><br>
								<br><h7>The sessions will be held over a term, sub-divided into teaching, designing, prototyping and making phases.</h7><br>
								<br><h7>The aim is to expose students to the fields of engineering and renewable energy. The workshops are framed around the current GCSE syllabus, encouraging STEM subjects by drawing on links with Maths, Science, DT and ICT course content. </h7><br>

							<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the objectives of the workshops?</a><br>
							<div class="cd-faq-content">
								<h7>Introduce students to basic engineering principles in renewable technologies, including bioenergy, wind, photovoltaic, and energy storage.</h7><br>
								<br><h7>Teach students to express their ideas graphically, encouraging innovative sketching and providing them with the design skills appropriate for drawing and labelling engineering diagrams.</h7><br>
								<br><h7>Give students experience in computer-aided design (CAD) and additive manufacturing. </h7><br>
								<br><h7>The students will experience a satisfying sense of taking forward ideas and seeing tangible results. </h7><br>

								<h7>PPL PWR is a collective of university graduates and students celebrating their research in the area of sustainable technology and innovation. The aim of the collective is to inform and inspire people to engage with this research and create a space for both individuals and groups to share knowledge with each other. We also provide opportunities for those involved to demonstrate and educate the public in a fun and engaging manner at festivals, workshops and in schools. We hope to create a greener world through the power of knowledge.</h7>

							<div class="cd-faq-content">
								<h7>We aim to engage and educate the general public about sustainable research and innovations, specifically but not exclusively those in our collective. The PPL PWR team brings a wide range of ideas, and experience to each event and aim to actively engage with adults and children about everything(!) sustainable. The team consists of experienced researchers, budding entrepreneurs and creative designers with a unique combined outlook on environmental issues, policy and technology. The combined backgrounds of PPL PWR members include several public lectures, music festival demonstrations, school visits, comedy shows and much more. </h7>
